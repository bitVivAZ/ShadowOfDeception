# Shadow Of Deception
Puzzle Platformer created using the Godot engine

Play at https://vivaz.itch.io/shadow-of-deception

My first game created using the Godot engine with gdscript which is a python-like programming language.

This was a huge learning experience and I've learned a lot creating this game in terms of programming and the Godot engine.

Things I would do differently next project:
- Create a full state machine
- Use global scripts rather then excessive over use of signals
- Name function better
